An irc bot engine that sure wants to dominate the world. It's still a work in project, so don't expect things to be working properly. Code contributions and reviews are very appreciated, just fork the project and send me a pull request.

As for now, there's no documentation. Some will be created when they're working, like the handlers documentation. Until then, examples should give a good idea on how it works (or how it should works).
